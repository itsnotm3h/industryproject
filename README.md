# Industry Project 1: PokeQuiz  

**PokeQuiz** is my first industry project, combining my passion for Pokémon and educational technology (edtech). This project is designed to make math practice engaging and fun for children by gamifying the learning process. Players navigate an interactive map to find Pokémon, and to capture them, they must solve math problems correctly. Each game consists of 10 questions, with Pokémon spawning at various locations across Singapore.  

The goal of PokeQuiz is to foster a love for learning by combining education with the excitement of gameplay.
